# How To Learn

**How To Learn** is my first full-fledged project in Yandex.Praktikum.
It uses HTML5, CSS3 and the previously mysterious BEM.
Not only the naming of classes according to BEM is used, but also the file structure is implemented by this methodology.

The project uses Flexbox, Transformations, Animations, different types of Positioning, SVG.
The main thing is a clean semantic code that is easy to support and develop.
